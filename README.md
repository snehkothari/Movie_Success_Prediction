# Movie_Success_Prediction
This program takes factors like actor/actress, genre and director of the movie and uses this criteria to predict the success or failure of the movie.

The code id in python and is performed on Jupyter Notebook. 
It uses Naive Bayes Classifier for detrmining the success and failure of the movie.
This has an accuracy of 62% if we disregard debutants.

CodeAccuracy.py
The codeaccuracy.py file can be used for creation of Confusion Matrix which is used to predict the accuracy of the model.
The dataset is divided into two files training and testing for codeaccuracy.py


Code.py
The code.py file takes the train data and according to the input values it predicts the success or failure. 
The output is just limited to success and failure.
Multipe values can be given as input for each factor by seperating them with commas.


Train.csv
The train.csv file has 1000 entries.
This is the IMDB dataset obtained from Kaggle.
